## Instructions to reproduce project
* Please start with **readme_main.pdf** for the instructions to run the Jupyter Notebook specific to Spark for the Pre-processing and most of the analysis.

* Please go through **readme_local.md** for the instructions to run the Jupyter Notebook specific to local machine which contains a couple of analytics based on the outputs of previous spark pre-processing.

We had to run it in two separate notebooks because of few limitations we are facing with Microsoft Azure HDInsights.
